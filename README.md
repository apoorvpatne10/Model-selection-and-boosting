# Model-selection-and-boosting

I'll be performing 2 such techniques :

1. K-fold Cross Validation - 

2. Grid Search - This helps us in finding the optimal values of hyperparameters. It tells us if we should use a linear model like SVM or a non-linear model like Kernel SVM to solve a problem.

3. **XGBoost**
